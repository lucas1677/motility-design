## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Teddarific/react-lib-starter.git
```

Rename the new repo to the name of your library, and go through the `package.json` to fill out your own details as well.

Install all the dependencies by running
`yarn`

To run the library, `yarn start`

To build the library, `yarn build:lib`

To build the docs, `yarn build:docs`

To publish your library, `yarn publish` or `npm publish`

## Typescript & Emotion

This starter takes advantage of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/core).

This is a personal choice, and I'd encourage you to give it a shot. If you're interested in using plain ES6 and regular scss styling,
see release v1 of this library.

## Directory Structure

Here's a peek of what the file structure looks like:

```
.
├── dist
│   ├── index.js
│   └── index.js.map
├── docs
│   ├── bundle.js
│   ├── bundle.js.map
│   └── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── Hello.tsx
│   ├── docs
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── webpack.dev.config.js
├── webpack.docs.config.js
├── webpack.prod.config.js
└── yarn.lock
```

Inside `src` is where your library will go, and where you can create your own custom React components!

Inside `docs` is where you can test your library, and ideal for a demo website that you can show off your cool components. It is what gets hosted when `yarn start` runs.

## Configuring Github Pages

The `doc` is all set up to run on gh-pages! Simply go into your repo's settings, and set gh-pages to run based off the source of `master branch /docs folder`. Assuming you've built `yarn build:docs` and committed it to master, the docs will be published to your gh-pages!

## Disclaimer

This is by no means the perfect starter pack. This is not set up for testing, nor set up for more complex Redux-based components. This is my personal vision for a simple starter pack to get a simple React component shared with the world!
